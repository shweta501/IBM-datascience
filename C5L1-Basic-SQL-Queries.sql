/*
Question 1: Were there any warnings loading data into the JOBS table? What can
be done to resolve this?
Answer: Yes, there were warnings about data being truncated. Some job titles were
longer than the specified length for the column. The number of characters allowed
for the column should be increased.
*/

/*
Question 2: Did all rows from the source file load successfully in the DEPARTMENT
table? If not, are you able to figure out why not?
Answer: No. There were two DEPT_ID_DEP with the same value (5). As DEPT_ID_DEP is
a primary key, duplicates are not allowed.
